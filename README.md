# Python CRUD Application for Inventory Management of a Store

A comprehensive Python application for managing **Stock** data of an **Inventory/Warehouse or some type of Storage Facility** with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

---

## 📌 Business Understanding

This project caters to the **various industries** that keep track of inventory in a warehouse. It can be used in:

- Supermarkets (e.g., Indomaret, Alfamart)
- Grocery stores
- Retail stores
- E-commerce warehouses for online resellers (e.g., Tokopedia, Shopee)
- Manufacturing factories
- Logistics and distribution centers

**Stock data** plays an important role—for example, in supermarkets, most items go through a central warehouse first. This setup enables supermarkets to:

- Buy in bulk
- Store stock before shelving
- Rotate and manage items (especially perishable goods)

Since a single distribution center may serve multiple branches, having reliable inventory data is **critical for operational efficiency.**

### ✅ Benefits
- Storage and space management for supermarkets and the items sold  
- Save on costs when buying items in bulk  
- Improved data accuracy and consistency when moving items in and out of the warehouse

## 👤 Target Users

- Warehouse Managers  
- Inventory Managers  
- Truck Drivers  
- Shelf-Stockers  
- Procurement Personnel  

It helps them **buy, ship, and sell** items according to current inventory data.
