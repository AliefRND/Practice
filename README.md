## Business Understanding

This project caters to the **various industries** that keep track of inventory in a warehouse. It can be used in:

- Supermarkets (e.g., Indomaret, Alfamart)
- Grocery stores (e.g, Primo, HERO, Giant)
- Retail stores (e.g, clothing, electronics)
- E-commerce warehouses for online resellers (e.g, Tokopedia, Shopee)
- Manufacturing plants and factories (e.g, raw mining materials and goods)
- Logistics and distribution centers
- Automotive parts suppliers 

**Stock data** plays an important role in any business that handles physical goodsâ€”for example, in supermarkets, most items go through a warehouse system first. This setup enables supermarkets to:

- Buy in bulk (saving cost from distributors)
- Store stock before shelving by accurately tracking supply (allowing restocking at appropriate times)
- Rotate and manage items (especially goods with expiration dates)
- Perform product performance analysis

If a single distribution center may serve multiple branches of supermarkets, having accurate inventory data is **important for operational efficiency.**

### Benefits
- Effective Storage and space management for supermarkets and the warehouse  
- Save on different costs (such as opportunity costs, delivery costs, storage costs, etc)
- Improved data accuracy and consistency when moving items in and out of the warehouse

## Target Users

This application is designed for multiple roles, including:

- **Inventory Managers** â€“ Monitor stock levels, product data, and restocking needs  
- **Warehouse Staff** â€“ Record incoming and outgoing stock  
- **Procurement Officers** â€“ Track product availability before placing new orders  
- **Store Managers** â€“ Oversee product performance and identify best- or worst-performing products  
- **Logistics Coordinators** â€“ Ensure efficient movement of products between the warehouses, suppliers, and supermarkets  
- **Inventory Analysts** â€“ Analyze supply and demand to report on product performance  
- **Supply Chain Managers** â€“ Coordinate between warehouses, suppliers, and supermarkets

It helps them **buy, ship, and sell** items according to current inventory data.
